> [!WARNING]  
> This codebase is for Mercator v2 (also named Monocator because of its single container) and is still under development. Checkout the `v1.0` branch for the older and more stable codebase.


# Intro

Mercator 2 is a crawler based on [Mercator](https://github.com/DNSBelgium/mercator/tree/v1.0), but it has only one design goal: **ease of use**

# Getting started

```bash
docker run -p 8082:8082 ghcr.io/dnsbelgium/mercator:latest
open localhost:8082
```
                   
# Compared to version 1

Important differences compared to previous version of Mercator 
  
* Zero required dependencies to deploy it.
* Can be run as a single docker image 
* No longer requires a PhD in Kubernetes in order to deploy it ;-)
* It doesn't even need Kubernetes at all.
* Does not require any AWS services (but can optionally save its output on Amazon S3). 
* Uses an embedded [duckdb](https://duckdb.org/) database and writes its output as parquet files
* Only one Javascript dependency: [htmx](https://htmx.org/)
* Multi-platform docker images published to docker hub (x86 and aarch64) so it also works an Apple Silicon machines

# Compiling & running locally 

## If you have no (recent) JDK on your system

```bash
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
sdk install java 21.0.5-tem
sdk install maven 3.9.9 
```

## Compiling

```
mvn package
```
Will compile the sources and run all (enabled) tests. To run the tests, you need a Docker environment.

To run without tests and vulnerability scanning, use:
```bash
mvn package -DskipTests -Dsnyk.skip
```

## Running locally compiled version

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

To use a specific profile: 
```
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local
```

>[!NOTE]
> Using the 'local' profile will start mercator on port 8090 instead of 8082.

## Running the JAR file
```
java -jar -Dspring.active.profiles=local  target/mercator-*-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

```shell
java -Dspring.profiles.active=batch -jar target/mercator-*-SNAPSHOT.jar --in=./in/file.csv --out=./out
```


>[!NOTE]
> You need to run `mvn package` first.
> 

## Running duckdb commands

Sometimes you want to set up some duckdb stuff before you run Mercator batch or frontend.
E.g. create a persistent secret or install extensions.

You can do this by running the application with `duckdb` as first argument

```shell
# build the application
mvn clean package -DskipTests -Dsnyk.skip=true\n

# run sql script from file
#java -jar $(find target -name '*.jar') duckdb < install.sql

# run ad hoc queries
echo "select 'bar' as foo" | java -jar $(find target -name '*.jar') duckdb
# install extensions
echo "install aws; install httpfs;" | java -jar $(find target -name '*.jar') duckdb
# create s3 secret
echo "create or replace persistent secret (type s3, provider credential_chain)" | java -jar $(find target -name '*.jar') duckdb
```

## Java 23 & Lombok

Since Lombok is [not yet compatible](https://github.com/projectlombok/lombok/issues/3722) with JDK 23, we *compile* the sources with Java 21.
Once compiled, it is possible to *run* the application with Java 23.

# Running with docker compose

Build container image:
```
mvn jib:dockerBuild
```

* Store a username in ~/.env.grafana-username
* Store a password in ~/.env.grafana-password

```
cd ./observability
docker-compose up --renew-anon-volumes --remove-orphans -d
docker compose logs monocator 
```

The Mercator UI should be available at http://localhost:8082

Metrics are available on http://localhost:3000 
                 
# Instructions for running it in production

Will follow soon.

# Features
  
Mercator will do the following info for each submitted domain name
* Fetch a configurable set of DNS resource records (SOA, A, AAAA, NS, MX, TXT, CAA, HTTPS, SVCB, DS, DNSKEY, CDNSKEY, CDS, ...)
* Fetch one or more html pages
* Extract features from all collected html pages
* Record conversations with all configured SMTP servers
* Check the TLS versions (and cipher suites) supported on port 443
* Find work by scanning a configurable folder for parquet files with domain names

Other features:
* Publish metrics for Prometheus
* docker-compose file to start Prometheus & [Grafana](http://localhost:3000)  
  * with custom Grafana dashboards with the most important metrics

## Planned
* export output files to S3
* optionally receive work via SQS

## In progress
* show fetched data in web ui
